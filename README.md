##🚨 Basic Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System

This project is a basic Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS) built with the open-source tool Suricata.
It is designed to monitor, detect, and prevent intrusions on a network in real time.

🔎 Features

✅ Intrusion Detection & Prevention with Suricata in IDS/IPS mode

✅ Integration of Emerging Threats (ET) ruleset for up-to-date threat intelligence

✅ Custom rules added in custom.rules

✅ Support for response mechanisms (blocking malicious traffic using NFQUEUE & iptables)

✅ JSON logging (eve.json) for easy integration with visualization tools (e.g., Kibana, ELK stack)

⚙️ Technologies Used

Suricata – IDS/IPS engine

Emerging Threats Rules – community & professional threat detection signatures

Custom Rules –

iptables + NFQUEUE – traffic redirection and blocking
